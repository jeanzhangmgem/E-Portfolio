## About Me

Hi, welcome to my E-Portfolio. I am a nature-oriented woman living on the traditional and unceded territories of the Musqueam People. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Geomatics in Environmental Management at UBC, Canada. I have worked in the environmental field, both in the non-profit and the government sector. Besides coding in front of a screen, I enjoy birdwatching and cooking in my spare time.
